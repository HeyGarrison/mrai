# Internal Team Documentation

## Overview

This module is designed to handle user management operations within our application, specifically focusing on retrieving and creating user data. It is a part of our backend services and is intended for internal use by our development team. The module is built using JavaScript and leverages the `h3` library for handling HTTP events.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to provide a simple and efficient way to manage user data. It fits into our architecture as a microservice that handles user-related operations, ensuring that our application remains modular and scalable. By isolating user management functionality, we can maintain a clean separation of concerns and facilitate easier maintenance and updates.

## Team Standards

This module adheres to our team's coding standards by:

- Using asynchronous functions to handle I/O operations, ensuring non-blocking behavior.
- Implementing error handling using `createError` to provide meaningful HTTP status codes and messages.
- Following our naming conventions and code structure for consistency across the codebase.
- Utilizing mock data for development and testing purposes, which aligns with our practice of using test-driven development.

## Maintenance

Team members should be aware of the following when maintaining this module:

- **Mock Data:** Currently, the module uses a mock database for user data. When integrating with a real database, ensure that the database connection and query logic are correctly implemented.
- **Error Handling:** Any changes to error handling should maintain the current structure to ensure consistent API responses.
- **Search and Pagination:** The search functionality is case-insensitive and simple. If more complex search capabilities are required, consider integrating a search library or service.
- **ID Generation:** User IDs are generated using `Date.now()`. For production, consider using a more robust ID generation strategy, such as UUIDs.

## Dependencies

This module relies on the following:

- **h3 Library:** Used for handling HTTP events and requests. Ensure that the library is up-to-date and compatible with our application.
- **Internal Utilities:** Functions like `getMethod`, `getQuery`, and `readBody` are part of our internal utilities. Any changes to these utilities should be reflected in this module.

## Deployment

There are no special deployment considerations for this module. It should be deployed as part of our standard deployment pipeline. However, ensure that any changes to the module are thoroughly tested in a staging environment before going live.
