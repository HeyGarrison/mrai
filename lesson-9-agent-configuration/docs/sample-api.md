# Documentation for `sample-api.js`

Hey there! Welcome to the documentation for `sample-api.js`. This file is all about handling HTTP requests for user management tasks like getting a list of users or adding a new one. Let's dive into the details of how each function works and what you need to know to use them effectively.

## Functions Overview

**Parameters:**
- `event`: The HTTP event object that contains details about the incoming request.

**Usage:**  
- If the request method is `GET`, it calls the `getUsers` function to retrieve users.
- If the request method is `POST`, it calls the `createUser` function to add a new user.
- For any other request method, it throws an error with a 405 status code, indicating that the method is not allowed.

### 2. `getUsers`
