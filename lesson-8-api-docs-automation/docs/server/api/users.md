# Documentation for `server/api/users.js`

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the user management API defined in the `server/api/users.js` file. The API supports two main operations: retrieving a list of users and creating a new user.

## Overview

The API is designed to handle HTTP requests for user management. It supports the following methods:
- `GET`: Retrieve a list of users with optional pagination and search functionality.
- `POST`: Create a new user with required fields.

## Function Documentation

### `defineEventHandler`

This is the main event handler that processes incoming HTTP requests. It determines the request method and delegates the request to the appropriate function.

#### Parameters
- `event`: The event object representing the HTTP request. It contains information about the request method, query parameters, and body.

#### Returns
- A promise that resolves to the response object based on the request method.

### `getUsers`

Retrieves a list of users from a simulated database. It supports pagination and search functionality.

#### Parameters
- `event`: The event object representing the HTTP request.

#### Returns
- A promise that resolves to an object containing:
  - `users`: An array of user objects that match the search criteria (if provided).
  - `pagination`: An object containing the current page and limit of users returned.
  - `total`: The total number of users available.

#### Example Response
```json
{
  "users": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane@example.com" }
  ],
  "pagination": { "page": 1, "limit": 10 },
  "total": 2
}
```

### `createUser`

Creates a new user based on the provided request body. It requires the user's name and email.

#### Parameters
- `event`: The event object representing the HTTP request.

#### Returns
- A promise that resolves to an object containing:
  - `user`: The newly created user object.
  - `message`: A success message indicating that the user was created.

#### Throws
- Throws an error with a status code of `400` if the required fields (`name` and `email`) are missing.

#### Example Response
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1633036800000,
    "name": "Alice Johnson",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "created": "2023-10-01T12:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "message": "User created successfully"
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Retrieving Users

To retrieve users, send a `GET` request to the API endpoint. You can include optional query parameters for pagination and search.

#### Request
```http
GET /api/users?page=1&limit=10&search=John
```

#### Response
```json
{
  "users": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" }
  ],
  "pagination": { "page": 1, "limit": 10 },
  "total": 1
}
```

### Example 2: Creating a New User

To create a new user, send a `POST` request to the API endpoint with a JSON body containing the user's name and email.

#### Request
```http
POST /api/users
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Alice Johnson",
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}
```

#### Response
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1633036800000,
    "name": "Alice Johnson",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "created": "2023-10-01T12:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "message": "User created successfully"
}
```

### Error Handling

If an unsupported HTTP method is used, the API will respond with a `405 Method Not Allowed` error.

#### Example Error Response
```json
{
  "statusCode": 405,
  "statusMessage": "Method not allowed"
}
```

If the required fields are missing when creating a user, the API will respond with a `400 Bad Request` error.

#### Example Error Response
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "statusMessage": "Name and email are required"
}
```
